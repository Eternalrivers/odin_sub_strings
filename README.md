# odin_sub_strings
Project: Sub Strings

#This is a project to demonstrate basic understanding in using ruby methods

* Create method #odin_sub_strings
* The method takes two arguments:
    * A word
    * And an array of valid substrings declared inside a variable
* The method will evaluate the two arguments to return a hash containing
  the listing of each substring found inside the original string
    *The hashes should tally how many times the substring was found
* Method should evaluate multiple words(case insensitive)
